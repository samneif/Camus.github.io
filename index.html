    <h1>In The Midst Of Winter</h1>

    <p>In the midst of winter I found there was within me an invincible summer</p>
    <p>That makes me happy because it says that no matter how hard the world pushes</p>
    <p>against me, within me thereâ€™s something stronger something better, pushing right back</p>
<!-- Camus is one of my favorite authors and this poem in specific is one of my favorites of his writings-->
